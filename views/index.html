        <h1>Audio Visualizer</h1>
        
        <p>
            This tool visualizes audio represented by sine waves using Tweakpane monitors
            and the WebAudio API.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three different frequency tabs which each control an oscillator.
            You can change the frequency by inputting a number directly, using an
            exponential slider (the frequency = 2^x Hz), or by selecting
            an octave plus a note name.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also control whether a given oscillator is playing,
            as well as turn off/on all active oscillators.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> There may be some unpleasant distortion with higher gain values,
            I would probably keep it at or below 30.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Also note:</b> The visual sine waves are 'stretched' by a significant
            amount so the visualization can work in real time, but it still does not
            give an accurate representation of the wave above ~4kHz.
