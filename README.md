## Song Visualizer

https://a4-yasmine-aoua.glitch.me

The goal of this application was to make a music visualizer that a user could change the color of the visualization, the song, and be able to stop and start the application.

I faced a couple challenges when creating this project. The first challenge I faced was creating the song picker using tweakpane. I had an error that broke the song picker and buttons after it that took a while to find. A bigger challenge I faced was changing the shape of the visualization. I wanted to try something different then just rectangles so I replaced them with circles but drawing non-rectangle shapes is a lot more complicated because there isn't just one method you can call like fillRect(). I was not able to fill the inside of the circles I drew for some reason that I still haven't figured out but I actually like the way it looks better with just the outline of the circle so I decided to keep it that way.
