This project implements the Web Audio API to create sounds and play wav files upon user input.The user can input by pressing one of the buttons or using the number keys 1-9. User's are able to use the tweakpane panel in order to change the gain of the sounds and also tweak the length of one of the sounds. During this my biggest struggle was learning how the audio api worked and also setting up the audio api, since you are not allowed to do anything until a user's input.
