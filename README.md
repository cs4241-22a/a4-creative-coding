## A4 Webware

The goal of this application was to create a game where players could move through a maze like screen and make their way to an end goal. While making the app, I faced many challenges which mostly revolved around getting the player to be able to use the arrow keys to move, and getting the rectangles to show up in the correct place. If I had more time, I would make it so that the canvas changed when the player bumped into a rectangle, but right now the game just ends and the canvas freezes. I would also add more rectangles but after a bit it was getting quite repetitive, so I left some open spaces.
