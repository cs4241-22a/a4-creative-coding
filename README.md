## gabby start - source - online visualizer

hosting link: https://a4-hyoder.herokuapp.com/

used canvas API in browser to produce 2D visualizer for the song "source" by artist gabby start.
source by gabby start is a good song i have listened to it a lot today.
one challenge i faced was making the background animation work the way i wanted it to.
eventually i discovered that you can pause animations (rather than stopping and starting it altogether) which resolved the issue.

## list of input parameters for user
- pause / play button to start and stop playback and visualization freely
- volume slider ranging from 0 to 1 (default 1)
- playback speedÂ slider ranging from 0.5x to 3.0x speed (default 1.0)
- 5 color hex values coordinating to the 5 points in the gradient on the vis itself (default [ "#080806", "#977A74", "#EBE84D", "#EA3522", "#397326" ] )
