  - wasnt able to upload mp3 file directly to glitch so looked for a workaround and found it.
  - rgb values werent changing
  - script.js file not working so i got rid of it.
- the instructions you present in the website should be clear enough to use the application, but if you feel any need to provide additional instructions please do so here.
- step 1 download an mp3 of your choice
- step 2 set values of RGB by sliding the value sliders(Once you let the slider go it wont change. Idk why its like this and I spent 30 minutes trying to fix it)
- step 3 press the choose file button on the top left. and choose the mpc you want to play.
- step 4 press the play button and listen to your favorite music
