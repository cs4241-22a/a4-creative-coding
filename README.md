- the goal of the application
the goal of the application is to give people a drawing board where they can have some fun drawing and creating random stuff

The users can
* Change the pen color to whatever they want it to be
* Change the thickness of the pen they are using
* Add these blue circles randomly on their page when they click on the "Random Blue Circle". I did this one because I see that it is fun due to the  uncertainity
* Clear their whole page that that drew if they don't like it
* Additionally I have also implemented a method where they can download whatever they drew.


The most difficult part was the download. the first function I implemented wasn't working because the method I called wasn't supported by chrome and IE. I then changed my method and it works now.The circles that are randomly generated are done by Math.random() so sometimes they go out of the frame. I don't have the time to fix that but I would like to. I would also want to add animation if I had more time.
