The goal of this application is to create a nice comfortable 3D enviorment in front of Founders hall. The challenges that I faced was that I have to learn 3D scene 
creating from the beginning, futhermore, I have also learned lots of cool functionality about three js, like raycaster, a basic component for 3D shooting games, and the resources online really helped me grinding through
 this project. There is no specific rules attached to this, the only instruction to use the application is that relax and enjoy the scene!
