## Audio Visualizer

https://a4-ryan-darcey.glitch.me/

This project is an audio visualizer that visualizes the sine waves of the tones that are playing using Tweakpane and the WebAudioAPI. It allows the user to play up to three different sine waves at once, visually displaying them each separately, as well as the resulting combined sine wave of all the tones playing.

The user can adjust the frequency of each tone in several ways as well as control whether each is active or not, turn on/off all active tones, and adjust the volume/gain of the tones.

The main challenge came from using the Tweakpane monitors to visualize the sine waves rather than using the WebAudioAPI itself or some other tool better suited for that.
