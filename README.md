## Oscillator Fun

The goal of this application is to start and stop an oscillator, control the volume, change the frequency type and the frequency amount, and finally to control the detune value. A challenge I faced was getting the oscillator to start and stop more than once, and for the controls to actually change the oscillator once it had started. If this was working as intended, you would slide the ranges up and down to adjust the volume, frequency amount, and detune value. You would also select the type of frequency you want.
