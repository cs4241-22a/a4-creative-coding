## A Very Simple Drawing App

https://glitch.com/~a4-sandysandysand


This application is the very base level of a recreation of Paint in Windows XP. I used the XP.css framework to create the aesthetic feel of it and Canvas to start to create to a basic web based drawing application.
A big challenge for me came down to two things. One, I started a bit too late to truly implement the features in the website that I wanted to feature. Two, I had some basic knowledge of Canvas going into this project, but I can't deny that it was harder to reimplement than I orginally imagined. As of right now, the page will follow your mouse to create a simple line, but that is the full extent.
In addition, users are able to change the background of the webpage and the canvas using range sliders.

In the future, I would love to be able to add the Windows XP style color pallette across the bottom as well as ways for users to resize the canvas to their own wants and needs. It could also implement backend by using servers to save and send drawings.
