## Generation 1 Pokédex for Generation 1 Pokémon for Pokémon GO

https://a4-rluu1.glitch.me/

## Goal of Application

This is the Pokédex for Generation 1 Pokémon. The goal of this application is to introduce those who are not familiar with a Pokédex
and helps introduce them to world of Pokémon . With the help of HTML5, Javascript, CSS, SVG and D3 I was able to create a website using JSON data
provided by online datasets and present to you a working version of the video game Pokédex. This will help those who want to get quick information
for Pokémon GO when they aren't on the game themselves.

## Challenges

Some challenges I realized when creating this application was finding a way to best represent data in the site with so much available to use.
Creative design is dificult, however I put a little more time ahead to get the deisgn out of the way and really prioritize as much user interaction as possible
and eliminate any possible clutter of code and make the website application more user friendly!

## Last Notice to Users

Be sure to always click on the black screen before you go back and forth between the Pokémon. Also enjoy the music, feel free to press pause it if it's not your style.
