Jordan's Audio Visualizer - Assignment #4

http://a4-jrwecler.glitch.me

In this creative coding assignment, I created an audio visualizer using Canvas and the WebAudioAPI. Three songs can be played on my webpage while watching the waveform react to the music being played.

- The goal of this application was to display the waveform in a less traditional way, by using dots instead of a full bar to show the height of the waveform at a specific point. Another goal was for the visualizer to be customizable in terms of color of the waveform. 
- Challenges included finding how to make the waveform start from the bottom, and understanding the fundamentals of how the WebAudio API worked.
- Use the color slider to change the color of the dots that make up the waveform. Use the drop-down menu to select a song. Use the start and stop buttons to start and stop the selected song.
