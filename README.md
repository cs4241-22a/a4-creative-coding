## 3D Audio Visualizer

This application is using for visulisation of the audio. User is allowed to either drag his own audio for viewing or just playing the default theme. THe most challenge thing during the process is that I'm tring to render some real time things and the light environment. Since I've done WebGL before with shaders but they are differen from computer graphics to the three.js, I've spent quite a long time for learning this tool and have used several public library and package for better animation and source control. The intersting I've used with one of the lib is called 'stats', which allowed us to check and monitor the code performence all the time.
