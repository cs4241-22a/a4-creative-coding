3D Visualizer
When you open the screen, it will prompt you a button to start.
Once the button is click, the 3D visualizer will start with a 3D grid ball visualizing the song "Tinh Ban Dieu Ki".

**Goal**
Goal of this project is an interactive experience and a visualized way to enjoy the music.
The tweakpane allow user to change their position with respect to the sphere (in z direction) to increase the visualized experience, User can also use the tweakpane to change the background color, the color of the sphere itself and the rotation speed of the sphere.
To create this, I used CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), Three.js and the audio.
The server side used Express

**Challange**
Some challanges that I face was importing Three.js and the tweakpane to the javascript file.
The solution was to add type = "module". Although it wasn't a big issue, it took me a while to figure out.
Approaching Three.js is also a leanring curve, however, there are many available resources there. It is very cool and if I have more time, I would love to explore the different 3D shapping and how to use tweakPane to change more aspects of the shape.
Tweakpane in overall is also very straightforward to implement but also require me to looks up the sources and example.
