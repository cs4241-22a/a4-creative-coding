**Goal** This project is an auditory, client-side, interactive experience. The goal is to create a 2D audio visualizer where the user can control visual aspects of the experience. There are at least four aspects of control, along with a usage of a server (Express). To create this 2D visualizer, I used Canvas, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), and the WebAudio API.
**Challenges Faced** The main challenge I faced was getting the CSS template to work with the project. Another challenge I faced was when I tried to put in sliders to edit the visualizer, but then I just took the route of using Tweakpane which helped me so much.
