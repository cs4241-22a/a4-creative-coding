## Online Ukulele

https://a4-nicholas-grumski.glitch.me

The goal of the application was to create an online ukulele that could be played like the real thing. The user can stum or pick each string individually, change the pitch of each string by using the keyboard, raise or lower the volume, and increase or decrease the sustain of the note.

My largest challenge was trying to match the timbre of the Ukulele as close as possible. By using the pluck synth and other filters from Tone.js I think I was able to match it pretty well.

The entire ukulele was drawn using canvases. Adjusting the Bezier curves were a bit diffcult, but I got a shape I liked after a while

Try strumming and playing chords. Ex: C = 3, G = 2 E S, D = W S X, Em = 2 E F
