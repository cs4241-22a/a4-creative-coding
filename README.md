## Moene's 135 Machine

Moene's 135 Machine is exactly what the title says: It's a chord machine that does 135(and 1357) chord. It also contains a simple drum machine. It uses Gibber as the audio backend. The user can change the BPM, ocative, switch between 135/1357 mode, change drum machine pattern, and change pitch of the 135 chord. It still follows the WPI 2000 style.

The main challenge I faced is that Gibber.Audio library was not that well tested compared to the Gibber Playground. I faced some bug but I worked with professor Charlie closely to resolve these issues.

Please follow the instruction on the website and have fun! I listed some songs that you can try out.
