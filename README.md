Summary:
This application allows a user to interact with a grid using keyboard
and mouse controls and play Conway's game of life

- the goal of this application was to implement Conway's Game of Life
  using the HTML canvas in conjunction with javascript
- Some challenges I ran into was with implementing the updating of the grid
  between generations since I didn't know how to introduce time to javascript
  which is a largely asynchronous language. I also had challenges as I was originally
  asigning my next and current arrays to each other which was making them the same 
  array, not assigning them the same values
