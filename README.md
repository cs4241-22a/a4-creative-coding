## Color Changer Visualizer
https://a4-sean-oconnor.glitch.me/

The Color Changer Visualizer is a web application that utilizes the WebAudio API and the Canvas API. Users pick between four songs, with their chosen song being played and having a 2D visualizer correspond to the audio. 

Using a pane created through Tweakpane, users can modify the visual look of the visualizer. Users can set the individual red, green, and blue values in the visualizer's RGB values, set the hex value of the background, change the height of the visualizer lines, and change the width of visualizer lines. 

The most challenging aspect of the application was the implementation of Tweakpane. Specifically, getting Tweakpane to work properly took some time and required rearranging parts of the client.js script, but soon the pane was working as intended and additional properties were added.

Instructions are provided within the site for starting the visualizer and changing the properties.
