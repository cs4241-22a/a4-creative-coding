## Country Population Vis

https://a4-colb131.glitch.me/

This project visualizes the US, China, and India populations from 1960 to 2021. Data obtained from https://github.com/jdorfman/Awesome-JSON-Datasets.

- This project is a way of exploring d3 in showing a visualization of population data from China, the US, and India.
- The biggest challenges I faced were in hosting the server, as glitch did not like many of the ways I ws testing locally, and d3's syntax, which is easy to use once learned but hard to learn.
- The user can use the tweakpane to adjust the graph, changing it's color, showing the line for the values, and changing the country, they can also hover over a bar to see it's exact value.
