## Music Visualizer

Glitch: http://a4-charlieroberts.glitch.me

Goal: The goal of the project was to create a 2D audio visualizer for the chosen songs. Three songs were picked: Nyan Cat, O-Zone Dragostea Din Tei, and Disturbed The sound of Silence.

Technologies: For this project I used Canvas (a 2D raster drawing API included in all modern websites) and D3.js (a library that is primarily used for interactive data visualizations).

Challenges: I faced multiple different challenges primarly when I was adding or changing parts of the code the whole application would stop working. I also had "intermediate value is not a function" error which almost crushed me, since I didn't know what the problem is. It turned our that I was missing a semicolon.

Instructions:
- Read the instructions on the page
- Press "Press to start" button
- On the top right pick a song, audio color, background color, and volume
- Press Play
- Press Pause to pause a song (same button)
- Pick a different song to play from the dropdown
