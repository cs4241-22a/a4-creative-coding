## Crude

Crude intends to be a simple agent simulation. It simulates dudes in a world of foods. If I had time, I'd implement carnivores in the form of "rudes" as well. As the ruler of the dudes, you can change the parameters of the race, as well as spawn in food and delete food and dudes alike. The goal is to demonstrate the effect of many variables on population growth. I didn't face any significant challenges beyond time limitations-- I never got to implement rudes. I did have time to style the webpage, however-- it's intentionally light on CSS as a play on the word "crude". This website doesn't fully support mobile devices, since you can't right/left click on most of them, but its layout is very compatible with them due to the use of flexbox.

Enjoy simulating the dudes!
