## Tree Generator

Heroku Link: https://treegen.herokuapp.com

I made a tree generator. It uses a canvas element to draw a tree using recursion and some random parameters. The user is able to tweak these parameters to create different trees.

The hardest part of the project was connecting all of the parameters from the GUI to the canvas.

Instructions are on the page.
