The goal of this application is to display bar graph and donut/pie chart data visualizations. The data comes from NASA's "Near-Earth Asteroids and Comets" dataset. This application was created by mainly using JavaScript Library D3.js. the Tweakpane Library and NodeJS were also used.


The main challenges I faced when doing this project
- Getting to Bar Chart and Pie chart to appear on the page
- initially learning the basics of D3
- fixing errors due to adding a string to a number (eg. 1 + "1" = 11, which messed up my y axis)
- I used the wrong fork to make this project ( a4 from last year), and transfering my file took awhile
