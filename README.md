# A4 - creative coding

Using the exmaple we did in class, I wanted to analyze a different currency. Instead of USD I looked at GBP.
based on how big the conversion rate is between currencies, the color of the circle intensifies.

when thinking of how to implement tweakpane I wanted to focus on color blind individuals. Here, the user can adjust
the background color of the body, and change which color intensifies with the circles (red, green, or blue).

the big challange I faced was loading the data from the json. I was initially going to do a different data set but
loading nested json values proved to be difficult. I also struggled with figuring out how to update the page in real
time based on the values in tweakpane.
