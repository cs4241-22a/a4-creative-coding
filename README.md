## Simple Audio Spectrum Visualizer

https://a4-rvrx.glitch.me/

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:
- The goal is to show a visualization of the audio frequencies in the song I am playing
- Challenges:
  - I took some time to get WebAudio up and running (I started before we went over it in class)
  - I originally wanted to do something with lyrics, but struggled to find a free API with 'subtitle' style lyrics (e.g. with time-mappings)
- **Instructions**: Open up the webpage, press the 'play/pause' button. EZPZ

## Technical Stuff
- Used WebAudio API for data and Three.js for 3D.
