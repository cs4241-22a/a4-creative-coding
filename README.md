## Interactive Sound Maker

Project Description:

The goal of the project was to do some experimentation with the web audio API. I drew insipiration from a couple of 'boombox' visualizations that I found on the interenet. Although the CSS is not as advanced, I wanted to allow the user the freedom to alter a similar number of sound fields. Two oscillators were created, a 'baseline' oscillator that operated at a fairly low frequency and a second that would have its parameters exposed to the user. The main challenge was to synchronize the creation of all the audio nodes with the relevant html elements. Further, I found out that once the oscillators were stopped, they could not be turned on again without re-establishing all the nodes. I had to think of ways to address that issue.
