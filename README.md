Have you ever wanted to create your own cat memes? Well now you can! Cat Meme Generator allows users to create and customize their own cat memes easily. 
For this assignment, I used Canvas to handle the image processing for this assignment. In order to make sure all memes are the same size, I developed a resizing alogrithm to crop and edit uploaded pictures to an appropriate width and height. After the base image is uploaded, users can customize the top and bottom text, as well as its font and size. The hardest part of this assignment was setting up the "live update" feature as well as the font selection and resize tool. I also spent alot of time working with Canvas to make sure the image always fit within the frame. If a user uploaded a massive image, it would take up the whole page.

- Technical Achivements
  - A simple server created using Express
  - Client-side image processing using Canvas
  - Live reloading/reprocessing (image reloads whenever a user makes a change)
  - A user interface with four parameters for user control
    - Slider to adjust text size
    - Image for the meme
    - Top and bottom text
    - Font selection
