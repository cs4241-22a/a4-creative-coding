`Three.js` option seems coolest, esp. the 3D audio visualization of a song

Requirements:
	- Express.js
	- Three.js with some (4) user interaction options (possibly using tweakpane)


Using the Web Audio API to play, and get data/nodes for a song, and use these nodes with some Three.js algo to generate shapes. Maybe look at PlexAmp or VLC visualizers for inspo.
