    <p>Conway's Game of Life is an infinite <small>(disclaimer: this one is not infinite)</small> grid of cells that can either be alive or dead.
        These cells can survive, die, or multiply, all based on a few rules.
        The rules are simple:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each alive cell with one or no neighbors (includes diagonals) dies, as if by solitude.</li>
        <li>Each alive cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
        <li>Each alive cell with two or three neighbors survives.</li>
        <li>Each dead cell with three neighbors becomes populated, as if by reproduction.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Depending on the initial conditions of the cells, various patterns are formed.
        Some patterns are stable (like a 2x2 block) while others oscillate (like a 3x1 line, which flips from horizontal to vertical and back). Some are even cooler, and
        are called spaceships. They translate themselves across the board. More information about this can be found <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">here</a>.
